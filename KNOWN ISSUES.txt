KNOWN ISSUES

NOT SURE WHERE THE INSURANCE JSON IS FROM. IF YOU DELETE I THINK IT AUTOMATICALLY REPRODUCES.
ONLY NEED SCREENSHOT IN WORD DOC. 
INSURANCE SECTION OF EXCEL SHOULD BE BLANK FOR MANUAL INPUT.
DO NOT NEED REMARK CODES ANYWHERE. ONLY ADDED SO THAT THE LLM/OCR IS SURE OF WHAT THEYRE LOOKING AT.
NEED TO CHANGE WHERE EXCEL AND WORD DOCS EXPORT. SHE ALREADY HAS FILES SHE IS REQUIRED TO USE.
ATTATCHED TEST IMAGES AND EXCEL.
HAVEN'T TESTED THE LLM WITH CPU ONLY.


I WANT TO EVENTUALLY TURN IT INTO AN .EXE AND HAVE THE REQUIRMENTS AUTO DOWNLOAD SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE POWERSHELL.
